Given an array of positive integers, find maximum possible value K such that the array has at-least K elements that are greater than or equal to K. The array is unsorted and may contain duplicate values.

Input: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Output: 4
Explanation : 4 elements [4, 5, 6, 7] 
            are greater than equal to 4

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation : 3 elements [2, 3, 4] are 
               greater than equal to 2

Input: [4, 7, 2, 3, 8]
Output: 3 
Explanation : 4 elements [4, 7, 3, 8] 
          are greater than equal to 3
 

Input: [6, 7, 9, 8, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation : All 5 elements are greater
              than equal to 5 
              
Expected time complexity : O(n)
