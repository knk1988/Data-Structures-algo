You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order. Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array. Traverse array only once.

Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] 
Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] 
Method 1 (Count 0s or 1s) 
Thanks to Naveen for suggesting this method.
1) Count the number of 0s. Let count be C.
2) Once we have count, we can put C 0s at the beginning and 1s at the remaining n â€“ C positions in array.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s
Given an array A[] consisting 0s, 1s and 2s, write a function that sorts A[]. The functions should put all 0s first, then all 1s and all 2s in last.

Example
Input = {0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1};
Output = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2}
